This is a demonstration of interaction with an elevator.

If you want to run it, just run a docker container with:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Then from the container run:
```
php -f index.php
```

It doesn't have a lot of documentation and explanation. There might be some edge cases with bugs, but this is just a demonstration!
